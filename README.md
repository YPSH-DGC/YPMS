### Package Submission
If you'd like to add a new package, please send us a pull request.
There are almost no restrictions on the type of package.
You can publish a library for YPSH as a package, or even your own CLI tool.
However, harmful packages may be rejected.
Also, since YOPR is an official repository, it requires a certain level of recognition or expectation.
You can also set up your own YPMS repository.
In that case, see [Custom YPMS Repository].

### Contributing to YPMS Itself
Contributions to YPMS itself are also welcome.
You can contribute via issue or PR.

## Custom YPMS Repository
Creating a YPMS repository is easy.

*Some file customizations may be required.
